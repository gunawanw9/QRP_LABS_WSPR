# QRP_LABS_WSPR
A wspr transmitter and general coverage receiver using the QRP Labs arduino shield and receiver module.

Status:   Work in progress

Major changes:

3/25/19 Changed the CAT control to emulate TenTec Argonaut V instead of Elecraft KX3.  It is a much simpler interface and\
had trouble getting WSJT-X to work with the Elecraft emulation.
