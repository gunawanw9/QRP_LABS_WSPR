# QRP_LABS_WSPR
A wspr transmitter and general coverage receiver using the QRP Labs arduino shield and receiver module.\
Headless design, no display or switches.  Computer controlled with WSJT-X, HRD, or stand alone transmit operation.

Status:  Works well.  Will be looking to add code for a Canaduino WWVB receiver module when it arrives in the mail.
