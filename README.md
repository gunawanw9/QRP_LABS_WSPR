# QRP_LABS_WSPR
A wspr transmitter and general coverage receiver using the QRP Labs arduino shield and receiver module.\
Headless design, no display or switches.  Computer controlled with WSJT-X, HRD, or stand alone operation.

Status:   Transmit usable now.   CAT works with WSJT and HRD.  Thinking about adding the QRP Labs OCXO.

Major changes:

3/25/19 Changed the CAT control to emulate TenTec Argonaut V instead of Elecraft KX3.  It is a much simpler interface and\
had trouble getting WSJT-X to work with the Elecraft emulation.
